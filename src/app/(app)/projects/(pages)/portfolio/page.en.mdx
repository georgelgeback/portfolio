# The Portfolio Website

![Image of the portfolio](/portfolio.png)

This website is currently a work in progress. It's written in TypeScript, with
Next.js and React since that's what I'm most comfortable with. Some of the
components used here are taken from the Shadcn library, and all of the
components use Tailwind CSS v.4. Localisation is handled with i18next. If you're
reading this on the web, it's being hosted using Vercel. All the code is
available on my
[GitHub page found here](https://github.com/georgelgeback/portfolio).

During my work with this website, I've learned a lot about the systems mentioned
above and how to use them, as well as how to singlehandedly see a project like
this through from start to finish. I believe this will be useful both in my work
on the same stack ([see the web project here](/projects/web)) and on entirely
different projects in the future.
