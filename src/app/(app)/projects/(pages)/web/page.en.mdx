# The Fsektionen.se Website

![Image of the calendar](/web.png)

Since the start of 2025, I have been working together with other members of the
programming committe at my student guild rebuilding the website for our guild
(the old one currently inhabiting fsektionen.se is about 11 years old). Much
like this website, it's written in TypeScript, with Next.js as the framework and
React as the general library. We make extensive use of tailwind and the Shadcn
library for styling, and localisation is handled using i18next. The website is
hosted on our own server and connects to the backend via FastAPI. The actual
database uses PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy for the ORM. I have limited experience
working on the backend, but I have worked on it enough to know my way around it
and to edit minor things I find in need of fixing. The code for the frontend is
available on our GitHub page [here](https://github.com/fsek/WWW-Web), and the
backend can be accessed in the same manner
[here](https://github.com/fsek/WebWebWeb).

Working on building the new website has given me tons of experience in working
in teams of different sizes, as well as how to work on features that need to be
adaptable enough to be changed as the design is finalised and customisable
enough to fit in entirely different parts of the website.
