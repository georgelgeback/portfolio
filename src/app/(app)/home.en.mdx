## About Me

Hi, I'm Georg!

I'm studying for a masters in Engineering Physics at Lund University, Sweden,
currently on my third year of five. In my free time I write code for my student
organization's website and app, which you can read more about below. Due to this
work, I've gained skills primarily within full-stack web development.
